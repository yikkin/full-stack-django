            <p>My children although wealth is something everyone loves to have,
nobody is born with it, nor can it be taken with them
                when they leave this earth.</p>

<p>my conviction has grown that the greatest meaning and value
in life lies in giving your all to contribute to the beauty
and betterment  of society i hope that all my sons and daughters
    can fully understand the truly meaning of life...</p>

<p>to leave my wealth to all society i hope the comapny i've founded
in this lifetime will be  managed with sustainability in mind
and be a blessing for employees and society in  the long run</p>
